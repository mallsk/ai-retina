# **App Name**: RetinaVision AI

## Core Features:

- Image Enhancement Analysis: Analyze and compare retinal image enhancement filters (Median, Gaussian, Bilateral, CLAHE, Gabor, Adaptive Histogram Equalization).
- Adaptive Contrast-Preserving Retinal Enhancement Filter: Apply and explain a conceptual 'Adaptive Contrast-Preserving Retinal Enhancement Filter (ACP-REF)' to improve retinal vessel and lesion visibility.
- Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Classification: Classify retinal images into severity levels (Low, Mid, High) with a confidence score.
- Doctor Dashboard Output: Generate key clinical findings, affected regions, suggested clinical actions (assistive), and follow-up urgency levels. Note: this application is for EDUCATIONAL and RESEARCH purposes only, it must NOT claim to provide real medical diagnosis and the output must be assistive and non-prescriptive.
- Patient Dashboard Output: Provide simple explanations of the condition, risk category (Low/Medium/High), lifestyle recommendations, and suggested next steps. Note: this application is for EDUCATIONAL and RESEARCH purposes only, it must NOT claim to provide real medical diagnosis and the output must be assistive and non-prescriptive.
- Evaluation Metrics Tool: Tool to provide realistic experimental evaluation metrics for the classification model: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Upload Image: Allow users to upload a retinal fundus image.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF), evoking a sense of medical professionalism.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5), offering a clean, clinical feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#00A36C) to highlight key findings and actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, clear presentation of information.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different retinal regions and clinical findings.
- Design a dashboard layout with clear sections for image display, analysis results, and AI-assisted clinical decision support outputs.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to smoothly display analysis results and guide the user through the information.
